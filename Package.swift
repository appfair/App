/// Additional source-only dependencies can be added, but the initial "FairApp" dependency must
/// remain unchanged in order for the package to be eligible for App Fair integration and distribution.

/// In order to set up a new App Fair project in a fresh fork, run:
/// ```
/// swift package --allow-writing-to-package-directory fairtool app
